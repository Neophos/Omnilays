# Omnilays
Omnilays is a program for managing overlays for tournaments. It uses a simple dashboard to control the overlay easily from a dashboard.

## Prerequisites

Omnilays runs on Node 10.15.2 LTS and NodeCG 1.3.1. You install it as a bundle for NodeCG.

There is a portable version for Windows here: https://mega.nz/#!HpgAVQDa!XX49b1lcm6CNY1WsaE68xQ78N95MxzJORwxU-ldRs3Y You simply download, unzip and then run StartOmnilays.bat to run the app.

## Usage

Omnilays is preconfigured to run on localhost:9090. It currently supports fetching tournaments from smash.gg.

Fetch the names using the SmashGG Dashboard, then make sure that the names, the round name and the match limit are all correct. Once they are, press "Start new match" to add the scores. Use the plus button next to the scores to add points.
